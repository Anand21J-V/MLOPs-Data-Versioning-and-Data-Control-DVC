# MLOPs-Data-Versioning-and-Data-Control-DVC
REPOISTORY FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW DATA VERSIONING ACTUALLY WORKS!

The repository at [Anand21J-V/MLOPs-Data-Versioning-and-Data-Control-DVC](https://github.com/Anand21J-V/MLOPs-Data-Versioning-and-Data-Control-DVC) focuses on implementing data versioning and control using Data Version Control (DVC) in machine learning operations (MLOps).

The repository contains several files and directories, including:

- **data/**: A directory containing datasets used in the project.
- **models/**: A directory to store trained machine learning models.
- **src/**: Contains source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **.dvc/**: DVC configuration files are used to track data and model versions.
- **README.md**: The main documentation file providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

To get started with this project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anand21J-V/MLOPs-Data-Versioning-and-Data-Control-DVC.git
   ```


2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd MLOPs-Data-Versioning-and-Data-Control-DVC
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3. **Initialize DVC**:
   If DVC is not already initialized, run:
   ```bash
   dvc init
   ```


4. **Pull the data and models**:
   Retrieve the versioned data and models using DVC:
   ```bash
   dvc pull
   ```


5. **Run the project**:
   Execute the main pipeline or scripts as described in the `README.md` to train models, evaluate performance, and manage data versions.
